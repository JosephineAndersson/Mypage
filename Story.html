            <h2>I've always been a sucker for gaming!</h2>
            <p><b>I was four</b> and the computer took about five minutes to even start. In the evenings I would sit in my father's lap and learn how to play computer games. It was difficult but it amazed me. 
                <br><br>
                <b>In the early 2000</b> I was in middle school and my teacher asked the class “Do you have any computer at home?”. I answered “Yes of course I do” while thinking the answer to the question was obvious (like duh, boomer?) even though many of my classmates said they didn't have any.

            <div class="Storytext2">
                As I got home that day I counted how many computers we actually had and I couldn't fit the counting on both of my hands. One on the kitchen table, one in parts in a random corner, one on my room, another one at my brothers. In the office there were multiple. 
                <br><br>
                <b>I was twelve</b> and I got to go with my father to a LAN. I brought my own (enormous and heavy) computer. It was only boys and men there, but I couldn't have cared less. We were all crowded closely together in an old cabin with network cables everywhere. In the middle of the room there was a large board with tournament results. 
                I got to face one of my dad’s friends in Starcraft. I won. My dad was so proud. 
            </div>
            <div class="Storytext3">
                It started early. Today I am 28 and my biggest hobby is still computer games and I am happy the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Combined with my love for gaming is now a passion for digital communities and for raising the ethos of professional players and gamers over all. 
                 <br><br>
                <b>I am aiming to work with what I love.</b> Because if there is something life has taught me it’s to follow my dreams and aim for what my heart tells me to.
